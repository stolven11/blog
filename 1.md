## Make A Simple Dashboard For Windows | Blog #1 | UNFINISHED

Maybe you deleted Cortana and need a dashboard... maybe windows 8 app picker sucks... well heres a solution!

### Step 1
Open a text editor and save as anything_you_want.bat **YOU NEED TO HAVE .BAT** (im saving as dashboard.bat)

### Step 2
Learn to do it your self or skip to step _

### Step 3
First we need to make a start page!<br />
```
:start
@Echo off
COLOR 84
cls
echo ---------
echo Dashboard
echo ---------
echo 1. Games
echo 2. Code
echo 3. Websites
echo ---------
pause
```
You can set COLOR to any color code you like... im using 84.<br />
Add echo ____ to add another page your making.<br />
```pause``` is just so the program doesnt close right away. You can remove in the next step.

### Step 4
Okay, lets make a variable to allow us to type 1, 2, 3, ect.<br />
Add this to your code...
```
set/p start=

if %start% == 1 goto games
if %start% == 2 goto code
if %start% == 3 goto websites

:games
cls

:code
cls

:websites
cls
```
As you can see I made the pages for each option and added a set/p function.

### Step 5
Create your pages... using echo to display, make sure each one has a cls to clear screen at the begining.<br />
Heres what ive done:
```
:games
cls
echo -----
echo Games
echo -----
echo 1. Minetest
echo 2. Growtopia
echo 3. Candy Crush
echo -----

:code
cls
echo ----
echo Code
echo ----
echo 1. VS Code
echo 2. VS Studio Community
echo 3. Command Prompt
echo ----

:websites
cls
echo --------
echo Websites
echo --------
echo 1. Google
echo 2. stolven11 Home
echo 3. My Blogs
```
### Step 6
Add function to your pages with set/p...<br />
Heres an example:
```
:games
cls
echo -----
echo Games
echo -----
echo 1. Minetest
echo 2. Growtopia
echo 3. Candy Crush
echo -----
set/p games=

if %games% == 1 start minetest.exe
if %games% == 1 start growtopia.exe
if %games% == 1 start candycrush.exe
```
Do for each page.<br />
