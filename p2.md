# Why I use Manjaro Linux [2]
#### In this blog post I talk about why I picked Manjaro Linux over other linux distros.
##### This post isn't finished as I am still finding new features.

## 1) Rolling release without breaking the OS.
### With this distro packages are always coming out and they are tested to not break your OS. The OS will always be up to date with a rolling release.

## 2) Easy on new users.
### This OS has a community that new users can talk to without being swatted away.

## 3) Driver support.
### When I installed the OS I didn't need to do anything to do install drivers or configure anything.

## 4) Based on Arch Linux.
### You can get all Arch Linux features without having to go through the hussel of setting up the graphical interface.

## 5) All packages work and are installed easily.
### If you install a package it will work and be safe because they are tested. To install it is also very easy with pacman and yaourt.
